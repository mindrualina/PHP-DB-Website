# PHP Website with MySQL, HTML, CSS

I have developed this project as part of a university course - Databases. The project involved the creation of a database using MySQL within the XAMPP environment, utilizing PHPMyAdmin for database management. Subsequently, a website was developed using HTML and CSS, where various functionalities were integrated through the implementation of SQL queries in the PHP programming language. The database contains tables for suppliers, parts, orders, and a catalog, so we could say it refers to an online auto parts store. The project aimed to showcase a practical application of database concepts, emphasizing the synergy between database management, web development, and the integration of dynamic content through PHP. 

The main page features a menu with four queries, each containing two subqueries. The database is accessed and capable of responding to user requirements based on their needs. This design allows for a dynamic and user-centric experience, providing access to many functionalities through a structured menu system.

The project unifies MySQL, PHP, HTML and CSS creating a harmonious synergy among these technologies.
