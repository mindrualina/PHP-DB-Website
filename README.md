# PHP Website 

I have developed this project as part of a university course - Databases. The project involved the creation of a database using MySQL within the XAMPP environment, utilizing PHPMyAdmin for database management. Subsequently, a website was developed using HTML and CSS, where various functionalities were integrated through the implementation of SQL queries in the PHP programming language. The project aimed to showcase a practical application of database concepts, emphasizing the synergy between database management, web development, and the integration of dynamic content through PHP.
